/**
 * The AI opponent - the same ship as the player in a different colour, flown by a
 * computer instead of a keyboard.
 *
 * It is built as two layers running at two different rates, which is how real
 * autonomy stacks are put together:
 *
 *   plan()    - the deliberative layer, every ENEMY_PLAN_INTERVAL frames.  Slow, global
 *               and discrete: decide what we are trying to do, and route through the
 *               cave with A*.  It writes a mode and a list of waypoints.
 *   control() - the reactive layer, every single frame.  Fast, local and continuous:
 *               a PD controller on velocity, a repulsive field to stay off the rock,
 *               and the trigger discipline.  It only reads what the planner wrote.
 *
 * That split is the "planning thread".  It is not an actual Worker: the game is meant
 * to run by opening index.html straight off disk, and a file:// page has a null origin,
 * where browsers refuse to start workers.  Slicing the expensive work across frames
 * gets the same result with no server and no build step.
